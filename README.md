# Fourier
Holds Python files for Fourier

This Program is meant to convert trigonometric equations into sound. It can convert any sinusoidal function into sound, and by Fourier's Theorem, this means that it can theoretically produce nearly any sound. It includes other tools to make the sound creation process easier.

The latest version, 0.4, fixed some bugs and added multi-export options.
