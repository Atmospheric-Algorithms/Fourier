# Fourier
Holds Python files for Fourier

This Program is meant to convert trigonometric equations into sound. It can convert any sinusoidal function into sound, and by Fourier's Theorem, this means that it can theoretically produce nearly any sound. It includes other tools to make the sound creation process easier.

While I made a .exe file for convenient use, sadly, it is too big to host on Github. The executable for Fourier 0.3 is available on DropBox at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/404r2n2md6ceuwhnl9brh/Fourier_0_3_exe.zip?rlkey=5gxrz8f5akw1lixdvxoths883&st=6d2g9503&dl=0
